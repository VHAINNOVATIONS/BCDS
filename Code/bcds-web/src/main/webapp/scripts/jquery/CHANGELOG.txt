==============================
*jQuery Core
==============================
- to overcome problems in IE7 when utilizing jqPlot, used IE debugger and found that in 7 places, an object was not null, but all
	of its properties (when accessed) say "Failed" in the debugger. Therefore, added a try {} catch{} first to test these cases.
	They are marked as: "// VBMS-R IE7". Had to first change the unminified version to find the offending line number, and then reminify it manually.
	

==============================
*jQuery UI
==============================
- override a few styles in rating-app.css to force desired styling
- Datepicker
 - Modified _enableDatepicker to add tabIndex to image (...filter("img").css({opacity:"1.0",cursor:""}).attr('tabIndex',$(a).get(0).tabIndex)...)
 - Modified _disableDatepicker to remove tabIndex from image (...filter("img").css({opacity:"0.5",cursor:"default"}).removeAttr('tabIndex')...)
 - Modified _showDatepicker to set focus to month dropdown rather than the input for 508 compliance (.../*b.input.focus()*/$(b.dpDiv).find('.ui-datepicker-month').focus()...)
 - Modified _updateDatepicker to set focus to month dropdown rather than the input for 508 compliance (.../*a.input.focus()*/$(a.dpDiv).find('.ui-datepicker-month').focus()...)
- Dialog
 - Modified open to properly prevent tabbing out of modal dialogs in IE7 using keydown instead of keypress, as is already done in later versions of jquery-ui (...&&d.bind("keydown.ui-dialog",function(e)...)
